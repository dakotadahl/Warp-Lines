# Warp Lines

An interactive line field animation that responds to scroll and mouse input. Lines converge toward a vanishing point as you scroll, creating a dynamic perspective effect.

## Features

- **Scroll-driven convergence**: Lines smoothly converge to a vanishing point based on scroll position
- **Interactive effects**: Mouse/touch input adds ambient noise and drag effects
- **Staggered animation**: Outer lines converge with a wave-like delay
- **Glow effect**: Radial glow intensifies as convergence progresses

## Usage

Open `Homepage/line-field.html` in a web browser. Scroll to see the convergence effect, and move your mouse to interact with the lines.

## Technical Details

See [SCROLL_EFFECT_OVERVIEW.md](SCROLL_EFFECT_OVERVIEW.md) for a detailed explanation of the scroll transition logic, animation timing, and interactive inputs.
